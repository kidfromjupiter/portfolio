  This is my Personal Portfolio website where I showcase my projects. I made this Portfolio
  so that it auto updates from my GitHub repos and Twitter post. I found it annoying that I had to manually update my portfolio
  every time I made a new project or post a tweet. So I automated the process.
  Feel free to check out the source code on GitHub!
